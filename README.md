Literate Programming Examples
=============================

This repository is a collection of literate programming examples, using Emacs Org mode.  The intention is for these examples to be directly usable (copy and start hacking), and/or to  serve as educational literate programs.


Prerequisites
=============

1. A recent version of Emacs, 24.3+.
2. Both =org-mode= (included w/ Emacs 24+) and =clojure-mode= installed;
   use Emacs ELPA as needed.
   - Consider using an Emacs "starter package" that provides a good
     baseline, like [Emacs Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/) or [Emacs Live](http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/).
