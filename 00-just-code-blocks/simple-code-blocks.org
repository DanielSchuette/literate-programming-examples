* Introduction
This file just shows simple usage of code blocks in Org mode; unlike
later examples, there are no Org =:tangle= file locations used here.
Instead, we just show how easy and convenient it is to mix structured
prose/markup with code blocks.


* 4Clojure problem 42 , [[http://www.4clojure.com/problem/42][Factorial Fun]] - first solved [2012-05-23 Wed]
Write a function which calculates factorials.

** My solution, <1 minute: reduce w/ range
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
#(reduce * (range 1 (inc %)))
#+END_SRC

** Other solutions: =reduce=, or use =apply= with =range=
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; maximental's solution:
#(apply * % (range 2 %))


;; daowen's solution:
#(apply * (range 1 (inc %)))


;; redraiment's solution:
#(apply * % (range 1 %))


;; sheldon's solution:
#(loop [x % r 1] (if (= x 1) r (recur (dec x) (* r x))))


;; vyzamyatin's solution:
#(reduce * (range 1 (inc %)))


;; amcnamara's solution:
#(apply * (range 1 (inc %)))
#+END_SRC
